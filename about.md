# Publishers: Ian and Trish Stedman

Magic Meeple Games is an independent tabletop games design, development, & publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona and co-owned by Ian and Trish Stedman.

MMG began when Michael Coe, founder of Gamelyn Games, approached Ian and Trish to co-publish a project with him. Ian and Trish (who have over 15 years combined involvement in various games industries) officially formed MMG in 2015.

Ian has had a lifelong passion for gaming, and is the designer of Magnum Opus from Clever Mojo Games and several other self-publishing projects.

Trish has been heavily involved with gaming conventions (including Phoenix Comicon, RinCon, and Crit Hit) for years as an experienced event planner.

Then they debuted with a successful Kickstarter campaign for Darkrock Ventures (designed by Michael Eskue of Council of Verona/TableTop fame), followed that up with another successful Kickstarter campaign for Fire of Eidolon, and yet another for Overworld in 2017.

Keep track of all their upcoming projects on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, BoardGameGeek, and their own website.

# Nemo Rathwald

"Overworld" is Nemo's first game to be published, but will not be the last. Nemo specializes in game components that physically prevent you from breaking rules, so you don't have to remember them.

Nemo got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.

He laser-cuts his game prototypes at the local hackerspace i3Detroit, where he teaches classes on how to use Adobe Illustrator to create cutting paths for machine tools.
